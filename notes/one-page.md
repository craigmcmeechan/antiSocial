People are getting annoyed with social networking. With good reason.

Is it the feature sprawl? Is it the commoditization and commercialization of our personal lives? Is it the corporate control and exploitation of our musings? Is it the censorship of language and images that shoehorns the entire world into a conservative North American sense of propriety? Is it the leaking sieve of facebook sharing our personal information with parties unknown for reasons unknown?

Ultimately what bothers people most is this; __even though we use this for very personal purposes, its purpose is anything but personal.__ It's not really a community. It's a machine that funnels us into demographic groups for the purpose of making us a into a lucrative commodity. **Ultimately we are here to provide free content to an ad network.**

As a result, this has become dull and mostly a habit. This is not to say that we don't think that having a place to share things and talk to acquaintances, friends and communities is not important. __We just think that facebook gives the illusion of doing those things while actually doing something completely different.__

There are other ways to do this sort of thing. Better ways.

* A social networking ecosystem should be not built on a single company or application but on an open protocol.

* User should have total control and ownership of their information and content.

* All sharing of information should be under explicit control of the users.

* Protocols embracing the decentralized approach that the internet was designed for and that the cloud enables.

* User to user strong encryption. Each friend relationship has its own keys.

It's simple really. Making friends. Sharing with friends. Getting notified about what friends are sharing. Just that. Nothing else.

Economically this would be user supported. Per user server costs are a few dollars a year. No need for advertising support.

#### Current status

We have a rough working prototype that implements a model of a distributed social networking platform.

- Distributed user centered architecture
- Friend/Follower connections supported across the network
- Social network made up of many servers operated by individuals and organizations
- Total user control and ownership of content
- Total user control over who sees what
- End-to-end strong cryptography and signed messages for communication between servers that can only be decrypted by the target user
- User can move their data from server to server at will w/o disrupting their friend network
- Instant notification of activity in friend network just like a centralized service
- More expressive posts: typography, imagery, multiple links
