With every passing day, and with increasing levels of alarm there is some new revelation of how social networks have revealed some of our most personal data to third parties or the public. It has reached a crisis point.

One solution is to retake control and ownership of our information and only allow to those who we expressly permit access to that data.

Our solution, which we call **antiSocial**,  is built around individual user or group-operated nodes powered by Open Source software and using publicly published Internet protocols, while utilizing strong encryption for inter-node communication, each key unique to the individual relationship, thus shielding it from prying eyes.

Each node is independently operated and core user data only remains there under the control of the node operator. Node operators may collect a fee to offset operational costs so there is no need for advertising revenues and the third-party data mining that comes along with it.

The code is Open Source distributed under the MIT License.
